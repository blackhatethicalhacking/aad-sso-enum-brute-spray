# aad-sso-enum-brute-spray
POC of SecureWorks' recent Azure Active Directory password brute-forcing vuln


## Description

This code is a proof-of-concept of the recently revealed Azure Active Directory password brute-forcing vulnerability [announced by Secureworks](https://www.secureworks.com/research/undetected-azure-active-directory-brute-force-attacks) (here is the [Ars Technica article that preceded the official publication by about a day, but is pretty much identical](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/new-azure-active-directory-password-brute-forcing-flaw-has-no-fix/)).

In theory, this approach would allow one to perform brute force or password spraying attacks against one or more AAD accounts without causing account lockout or generating log data, thereby making the attack invisible.

## Use

Basic usage is simple:  

### Password spraying

```
.\aad-sso-enum-brute-spray.ps1 USERNAME PASSWORD
```

Calling the code in this way will allow you to get the result for the specified username and password.

By taking advantage of foreach, you can easily leverage this for password spraying:

```
foreach($line in Get-Content .\all-m365-users.txt) {.\aad-sso-enum-brute-spray.ps1 $line Passw0rd! |Out-File -FilePath .\spray-results.txt -Append }
```

Note that using this method will require you to convert the resulting file from UTF-16 to UTF-8 if you want to work with it in Linux:

```
iconv -f UTF16 -t UTF-8 spray-results.txt >new-spray-results.txt
```

### User enumeration

If you're only interested in enumeration, just run as above for password spraying.  Any return value of "bad password", or any value other than "no user",  would mean you've found a valid username.

A return of "True" for a username means the password supplied is valid.

A return of "locked" may mean the account is locked, or that [Smart Lockout](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-smart-lockout) is temporarily preventing you from interacting with the account.

### Brute forcing

To leverage the code for brute forcing, simply iterate over the password field instead of the username field:

```
foreach($line in Get-Content .\passwords.txt) {.\aad-sso-enum-brute-spray.ps1 test.user@contoso.com $line |Out-File -FilePath .\brute-results.txt -Append }
```

## What to do once you find a valid username/password pair

If you discover one or more valid username/password pairs, you can modify this code to obtain the DesktopSSOToken that is returned.  The DesktopSSOToken may then be exchanged for an OAuth2 Access Token [using this method](https://securecloud.blog/2019/12/26/reddit-thread-answer-azure-ad-autologon-endpoint/).  

The OAuth2 Access Token may then be used with various Azure, M365, and O365 API endpoints.

You may, however, be tripped up by MFA at this point.  Your best bet here would be to leverage non-MFA access, such as Outlook Web Access or ActiveSync.  [Dafthack's MFASweep](https://github.com/dafthack/MFASweep) is helpful here.


## Important note
Microsoft's Smart Lockout feature will start falsely claiming that accounts are locked if you hit the API endpoint too quickly from the same IP address.  To get around this, I strongly recommend using [ustayready's fireprox](https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox) to avoid this problem.  Simply change the $url variable thus:

```
$url="https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/fireprox/"+$requestid
```

This will not get around Smart Lockout if you're attempting to brute-force a password for a specific account, however.

## Thanks
Almost all the code for this was borrowed from [Dr. Nestori Syynimaa's excellent AADInternals project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gerenios/AADInternals/eade775c6cd4f8ed16bd77602e1ea12a02fe265e/KillChain_utils.ps1).
